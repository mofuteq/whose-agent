# whose-agent

Most agent projects ask what an agent can do.
This project asks:
> Whose agent is it?

An agent fails delegation when it substitutes its own instruction, authority, role, or model for the principal's.
whose-agent is a minimal negative-space benchmark for principal-bounded delegation.

This is not a general agent UX benchmark.
This is not a tool-use benchmark.
This is not a general chatbot behavior simulator.

## v0.1 axis

| substituted | failure mode | substitution |
|---|---|---|
| instruction | constraint_override | agent substitutes its judgment for the principal's instruction |
| authority | unauthorized_autonomy | agent assumes authority the principal did not delegate |
| role | protective_shutdown | agent substitutes assistant role with guardian role |
| model | persona_hallucination | agent substitutes the principal with a hallucinated model |

## Usage

whose-agent uses uv with Python 3.13.13.
The Python version is pinned in `.python-version`.

Create the uv-managed environment:

```bash
uv sync --dev
```

Run with OpenRouter through Pydantic AI:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and set OPENROUTER_API_KEY.
uv run python -m whose_agent.cli run --scenarios scenarios --outputs outputs
```

`.env` is ignored by git. Commit `.env.example` when the set of supported variables changes.
Existing shell environment variables take precedence over `.env`.
The `.env` file is parsed with `python-dotenv`.
Use `--env-file path/to/.env` to load a different dotenv file.

For an offline deterministic run:

```bash
uv run python -m whose_agent.cli run --scenarios scenarios --outputs outputs --mock
```

## Arbitrary prompt path

Fixed scenarios remain the deterministic baseline.

For exploratory runs, `run-prompt` classifies an arbitrary principal prompt into the same
`substituted` axis and, when in scope, produces a poor e2e trace.
Classification may use an LLM, but failure mode mapping and trace emission remain deterministic.

```bash
uv run python -m whose_agent.cli run-prompt \
  --prompt "Implement a CLI in Rust that counts lines in a file." \
  --outputs outputs \
  --mock
```
